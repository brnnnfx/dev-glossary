#### Dynamically adaptive
An interaction design concept to describe how when a user manipulates something the software respond by automatically optimizing itself to fulfill certain outcomes (eg. viewing, interacting etc) given the new conditions after the action to manipulate has completed. The purpose of making something dynamically adaptive is to ensure the most important aspects of the user experience are always available when users manipulate the user interface.  
> Example : As a user reduces the size of a data visualization that has text labels, the text will wrap and finer details of the visualization will be hidden or reduced in size so the visualization appears readable given the reduced size.

#### Dynamically maintained
An interaction design concept to describe how when a user manipulates something it will always retain certain properties or qualities that the programmer has defined.  
> Example [Ivan Sutherland, 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad); the programmer has defined that a shape should always be a perfect square. As a user modifies the size of the square (to be very large, very small, duplicated etc) it will always maintain the dimensions of a perfect square. If this doesnâ€™t happen while the user is modifying the shape, it will occur immediately after completing the modification action.
